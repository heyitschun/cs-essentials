# What are algorithms and data structures?

An **algorithm** is a finite sequence of instructions to accomplish a task.

For an algorithm to be viable, it must be able to be broken down into simple and definite steps that can be performed by a computer.

A **data structure** is an arrangement of data in a computer's memory to represent values of a set of values of an abstract data type.
