A **queue** is an abstract data type (ADT) that holds an ordered sequence of elements. Access to the queue is restricted to the front and back of the queue. Entering the queue is done at the back and leaving the queue is done from the front; therefore, a queue is an ADT that follows the first-in-first-out protocol.
